# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 1: April 01, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Started the module on regular expressions
**Thoughts:** A bit tough to understand at first but got to crack it after reading it again for few times and managed to hit the green light in the run test submit .

Day 2 April 02, 2019
** Today's Progress** Continuing with the module on regular expressions
Rgex getting easier to understand now :-)

Day 3 April 03, 2019
**Today's Progress** Continuing with the module on regular expressions lessons
Regular Expressions: 
-find more than the first match
-Match anything with wildcard period
-Match single character with multiple possibilities challenge : got stuck here/ I had done a small mistake by placing the flag before the slash but now it is rectified thanks to the suggestion of one the code campers.
-Match letters of the alphabet
-Match letters of the alphabet and numbers 
-Match single characters not specified
-Match characters that occur one or more times
